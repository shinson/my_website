    <div class="container-fluid">
    <p>Born and raised in Atlanta, I moved to Chicago to attend the University of Chicago.
    After many grueling years of selling my soul to academic gods (Plato, Smith, etc.), I decided to have some fun. 
    I learned Arabic and studied abroad in Jerusalem and Irbid, Jordan. After a short stint in Middle East research, 
    I was not feeling the impact of the work I was doing, so thankfully with a little bit of luck and a good sales pitch, 
    I landed a job in Syrian humanitarian relief.</p>
    <p>I have always incorporated learning tech into my daily life, but it wasn't until January 2014 did I take this passion
    into full speed. With the help of the tremendous DC women in tech movement I have learned way more skills than i ever did in 
    college. With a focus in web development and programming, I hope to use these skills to bridge the gap between
    technology and humanitarian/development programs. </p></div>
